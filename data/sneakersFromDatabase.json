A soft green hue is applied to the suede upper, equipped with clear quarter-panel netting and tonal TPU eyelets. Contrasting pink accents make their way to the Jumpman logo atop the silver reflective tongue, as well as the signature shark tooth detailing that decorates the black polyurethane midsole. Encapsulated Nike Air in the forefoot is joined by a visible Air sole unit in the heel, both of which are supported underfoot by an icy translucent outsole.",

      "story": "The CLOT x Nike Air Max 1 ‘Kiss of Death CHA’ delivers a play on the original collaboration between the Swoosh and Edison Chen’s streetwear brand. While the older shoe was inspired by reflexology, its successor takes its design cues from tea, deemed by CLOT as one of the necessities of Chinese life. The original’s defining attributes remain unchanged, including a clear toe box, deconstructed collar and translucent rubber outsole, the latter marked with a familiar pressure-point graphic. The suede upper is rendered in tan and brown paneling with a red leather Swoosh. The same crimson hue is repeated on CLOT branding embroidered on the heel overlay.",
